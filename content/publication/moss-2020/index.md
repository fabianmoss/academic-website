abstract: >
    This corpus study constitutes the first quantitative style analysis of
    Choro, a primarily instrumental music genre that emerged in Brazil in the second half of the 19th century. 
    We evaluate its description in the recent and comprehensive theoretical work *A estrutura do Choro* (Almada, 2006) by analyzing a set of representative pieces from the *Choro Songbook* (Chediak, 2009, 2011a,b), a central reference for this genre. We digitized this resource by transcribing the chord symbols and formal structure of all 295 pieces, and publish it as the freely available *Choro Songbook Corpus*.

    Our approach uncovers central stylistic traits of this musical idiom on empirical grounds.
    It thus advances data-driven musical style analysis by studying both harmony and form in a musical genre that lies outside the traditional canon.
